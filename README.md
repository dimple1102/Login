# Login
Login project with registration system.
This project consists of login and registration system.
Login allows only registered users using their username and password whereas signup or registration form allows new users to get registered
by storing their basic information(first name,last name,username,password,phone no.,DOB and country) in database.While logging in, this 
system fetches data from database and matches with the entered data and allows the user only if it gets matched.
